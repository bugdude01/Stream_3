Final Project for Stream 3

This app takes the original CandyLand website and re-builds it using greater functionality utilising
integrated front-end and back-end components together to create a beter, more inclusive user
experience.

## Key Features

As well as the usual "Take a look at what we do", of the initial website, things hae moved on so now
you can:

* Visit social media outlets for the Candyland Cart Company and see what's happening
* Make a booking request detailing how you would like the company to cater for your needs
* Register as a member of the Candy Club to get news and obtain discounts on bookings
* As a member, you are able to purchase sweet packages directly from the site
* In addition, you can also take out a "Sweet Subscription", enabling you to have a sweet hamper
  delivered to you on a monthly basis
* Take part in surveys / polls about sweet related stuff and post up a review thread on an event you
  may have booked or attended

## How does this one work?

This app uses the following tech to do its thing:

* Django and Python does all the heavy lifting framework wise and keeps everything both linked up AND nicely
  separated at the same time
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap for styling and ensuring cross browser and multi-display compatibility
*
